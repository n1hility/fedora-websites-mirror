"The Fedora community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers"
" from all over the world, working on every aspect of the distribution from "
"coding through to marketing. Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it "

"a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're using "
"project resources."

"Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no"
