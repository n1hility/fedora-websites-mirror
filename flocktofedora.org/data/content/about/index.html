But we grew, and it became time for a new approach: Flock. The first Flock conference was held in Charleston, South Carolina in 2013. This opportunity for Fedora contributors to come together, discuss new ideas, work to make those ideas a reality, and continue to promote the core values of the Fedora community will alternate each year between North America and Europe. The 2014 Flock was held in Prague, Czech Republic. In 2015, we returned to the US and held Flock in Rochester, NY.  The 2016 location is Krakow, Poland.')}

Flock is where you meet with other members of the Fedora community who share whatever your interest is, whether that\'s the kernel or the cloud, hardware or UX design. We also want to embrace and invite the growing open hardware community so that we can learn from one another and create better things together.')}

Just like Fedora, Flock will be thinking big. This conference will have four full days of talks, workshops, hackfests and sprints. We will have scheduled sessions covering these and other topics:')}
