          <h2>What is Flock?</h2>
          <p>Flock is the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/" target="_blank">Fedora Project</a>'s annual contributor-focused conference. It typically alternates between European and North American locations. The conference provides a venue for face to face meetings and conversations. It is also a place to celebrate our community.</p>

          <h2>What will we do at Flock?</h2>
<!--          <p>The <a href="https://flock2018.sched.com/">schedule</a> is now available.  Changes are still possible.</p> -->
          <ul>
              <li align="left"><b>Communicate the Fedora Strategy.</b> Everyone in Fedora should understand and feel well-aligned with the project's goals, both long-term and tactical. We should all understand the messaging we're using to attract new users and contributors.m</li>
              <li align="left"><b>Plan the Next Strategy.</b> This strategy doesn't come from the top down, or from thin air, and it's not dictated by our sponsors. It comes from the community. Because we're so big and distributed, Flock can't be the only place where we get new ideas, but it is a summit where we present, learn about, and discuss them.</li>
              <li align="left"><b>Build Community Connections and Engagement.</b> We do amazing work as a global project, but there's no substitute for direct human interaction. Flock helps tie us together. In-person discussion, collaboration, and fun social events help us function better on IRC and mailing lists throughout the year.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who comes to Flock?</h2>
          <p>While Flock is open to anyone, the majority of talks at Flock are focused on existing contributors and those looking to increase their involvement.  There is almost no solely user-focused content.</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Flock 2017 is a more <strong>action-oriented event</strong> than previous years. This affects the types of session proposals that were accepted. The scheduled slots favor collaborative team working sessions and workshops over team status reports.
          </p>
-->
          <h2>Event Dates</h2>
          <p>Flock will begin the morning of Thursday, August 8. Sessions will continue each day until Sunday, August 11. You should plan to arrive by Wednesday, August 7 and to depart no sooner than Sunday afternoon for the best experience.</p>

 <!--
	      <p>Coming soon...</p>
            <p>The CfP is now closed and the <a href="https://flock2018.sched.com/">schedule</a> is now available.  Changes are still possible.</p>
 -->
            <p>We invite you to submit proposals for talks (25/50 minutes) or workshops( 2 hours),  or hackfests/FADs (half or full day) on topics of importance to the contributor community.</p>
            <p>Topic ideas include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li align="left">Pitch an idea!  Have the next Fedora Rings, or Fedora Editions plan, or rpm-ostree, or something entirely new? Have something that bugs you and a plan to fix it? Think we should grow our userbase in a particular area by doing something we aren't? Pitch it!</li>
                <li align="left">Team planning for the next year. Mini-strategic-hackfests for various groups; for example, regional planning.</li>
                <li align="left">Focused hackfest for a team or topic.</li>
                <li align="left">Training for existing contributors on new processes (i.e. packaging updates or Zanata updates).</li>
                <li align="left">Onboarding/Join meetings for contributors</li>
                <li align="left">Your idea here!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are accepting proposals as issues in the <a href="https://pagure.io/flock/issues">Flock repository on Pagure</a>.  We are doing this so that you can solicit feedback on your proposal, look for collaborators, and figure out who you need in the room and who will be there.  Specific instructions are in the Pagure repo.</p>
            <p>Proposals are evaluated in three rounds and must be submitted by the beginning of the final round.  This allows us to confirm talks for speakers sooner than making everyone wait until then end.  This also incentivizes you to submit early :D.  Unselected proposals carry forward to the next round.</p>
            <ol>
                <li align="left"><p>Round 1 selection starts on: 1 June 2019</p></li>
