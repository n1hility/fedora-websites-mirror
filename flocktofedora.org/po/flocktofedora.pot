"For eight years, Fedora users and developers gathered at an event named "
"for them, the Fedora Users and Developers conference (FUDCon). But we "
"grew, and it became time for a new approach: Flock. The first Flock "
"conference was held in Charleston, South Carolina in 2013. This "
"opportunity for Fedora contributors to come together, discuss new ideas, "
"work to make those ideas a reality, and continue to promote the core "
"values of the Fedora community will alternate each year between North "
"America and Europe. The 2014 Flock was held in Prague, Czech Republic. In"
" 2015, we returned to the US and held Flock in Rochester, NY.  The 2016 "
"location is Krakow, Poland."

"Fedora and the people who participate in the project encompass so much "
"more than just an interest in Linux. Flock is where you meet with other "
"members of the Fedora community who share whatever your interest is, "
"whether that's the kernel or the cloud, hardware or UX design. We also "
"want to embrace and invite the growing open hardware community so that we"
" can learn from one another and create better things together."

"If you weren't able to join us for previous Flock events, you may still "
"be thinking of the FUDCon barcamp model. Flock, however, operates more "
"like a traditional conference. Just like Fedora, Flock will be thinking "
"big. This conference will have four full days of talks, workshops, "
"hackfests and sprints. We will have scheduled sessions covering these and"
" other topics:"

"The city of Krakow is the second largest city of Poland and is the "

"Poland."

"Krakow's seven universities, plus almost twenty other institutions of "
"higher education, make it the country's leading center of science and "
"education. The city's expanding service sector is the lifeblood of local "
"economy, but varied industry and production still provide substantial "
"proportions of jobs and wealth. Krakow is the metropolis of southern "
"Poland and the capital city of the Małopolska Province. The city has "
"about 755,000 permanent residents, and the Krakow conurbation totals some"
" 1.5 million people. The cosmopolitan atmosphere of the city center may "
"be somewhat misleading. Despite recent growth in the number of immigrants"
" and expatriates, inhabitants of Krakow remain ethnically almost "
"homogeneous and proudly declare their Polish nationality."
