		<h4>${_('What is your profession?')}</h4>
		<p>${Markup(_('Principal Software Engineer at &lt;a href=\"http://redhat.com\"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;.'))}</p>

		<h4>${_('What\'s your IRC nick?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('When I\'m on Freenode/Codehaus, etc, I use \'cbredesen\' so as to be  transparent about my identity.  Here at Red Hat, I go by \'breddy\' which  is a casual shortening of my last name given to me by a college buddy. I decided to keep it as a nick because it is vaguely similar to the first name of one of my Norwegian ancestors, Brede, (from whom my last name is derived).')}</p>

		<h4>${_('How did you first become a Java developer?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('My degree is in Computer Science but I\'d not been interested in a career in software development for whatever reason so I went down the sysadmin path.  I had been doing server administration for many years, building mainly departmental and corporate Windows networks.  I decided to get back into programming around 2001 and, due to circumstances, moved into a role doing Visual Basic development.  Not long after I joined, we changed platforms from VB/C++/Windows to Java/*NIX/Linux.  The rest is history.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('When did you first start using Fedora?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('Most of my development career has been devoted to the architecture and development of mid- to large-scale web-based e-commerce systems.  That sort of work takes most of my time but I\'ve got a few related projects in the works that I intend to release to the community and hopefully package for Fedora.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('Tell us about some interesting desktop customizations you\'ve done to your Fedora desktop to help your Java development workflow.')}</h4>
		<p>${_('I\'ve spent significant time in GNOME, KDE and XFCE.  I\'ve customized the desktop environment in many ways and arrived back at a fairly vanilla GNOME setup with Gnome-Do as a launcher. The only real customization I\'ve done to the system I\'ve flirted with is moving from Bash to Zsh due to some of the built-in command completion that Zsh offers.  Most of the workflow involved in creating Java applications is to do with the code/test/commit cycle made possible with Git, Maven and some of the other tools we use.')}</p>

		<p>${Markup(_('I\'m currently leading development of the &lt;a href="%s"&gt;Red Hat Customer Portal&lt;/a&gt;.

In fact my current team  consists of a graphic artist running Mac OS X - he\'s got a full copy of the &lt;a href="%s"&gt;Red Hat Customer Portal&lt;/a&gt; running and connected to our Git repository.') % 'http://access.redhat.com')}</p>


		<h4>${_('Do you have any tips for enthusiastic future Fedora Java developers taking their first steps in using Fedora to create awesome Java apps?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('Just to be aware that many of the tools that Java developers already know and love are available right out of the box in Fedora.  A dev workstation that would take me hours or even days to build with Windows or Mac OS X can be installed and running in less than an hour, thanks to Yum and all the great OSS software that Fedora has built and packaged.')}</p>
