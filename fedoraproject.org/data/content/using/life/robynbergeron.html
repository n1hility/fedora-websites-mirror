She uses Fedora to meet her day-to-day computing needs and uses it in her marketing work for the Fedora Project - which includes giving conference presentations. Learn how she does it in this chat!')}</em></p>

		<h4>${_('Where are you from?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('I currently live in Flagstaff, Arizona; I spent most of my life in Phoenix, which is about 2 hours south of where I am, and about 5000 feet lower. People always wonder why I\'m shovelling snow in the winter when I live in Arizona - very few realize that we also have a great high country environment, replete with pine trees and a ski resort :)')}</p>

		<h4>${_('What is your profession?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('I usually refer to it as \"domestic household engineer\" or \"domestic goddess\" - in other words, a homemaker.  I\'ve been in this role for about 7 years; before that, I had lives as a market research analyst, a business analyst doing strategic marketing, and I am also a recovering sysadmin.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('What\'s your IRC nick? Where does it come from?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('rbergeron - not very exciting :)')}</p>

		<h4>${_('When did you first learn about Fedora?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('A long time ago, back when it first started; I didn\'t become actively involved until I discovered the marketing group a little more than a year ago on the join.fedoraproject.org page, joined the mailing list, and was delighted to discover that there were outlets for all the knowledge I had built over the years - the writing, the sysadmin-type stuff, and of course, marketing and strategy.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('Can you tell us about one of the ways you use Fedora?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('Fedora actually meets a lot of needs in my household. My significant other uses it for his day job as a development platform; my daughter, who is eight, loves to use GIMP to make pictures, Cheese to take endless webcam photos, and Firefox to do some of her website-based homework; my son, who is six, also loves the online games, but is especially in love with the SuperTux game, which is reminiscent of a certain game with two Italian plumbers whom we all know and love. :)')}</p>

		<p>${_('For me, Fedora meets a lot of my day-to-day needs; I use Firefox to check my web-based email, the notepad to make endless task lists, empathy and pidgin to keep in touch with people through video and instant messaging.  For some of the work I do in Fedora Marketing, I have everything I need - irssi for chatting online in IRC, Firefox for keeping up with the wiki work that needs to happen for every release, and I make good use of Open Office for making presentations for conferences.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('How do you use Fedora to develop and give your presentations?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('I mostly use OpenOffice Impress - it does everything I need it to do. I occasionally use Inkscape for making diagrams to pull in, particularly if I plan on reusing just the diagram for non-presentation purposes - I\'m a big fan of having to do things once, and the compatibility to be able to pull those diagrams into OO for a presentation is definitely a win for me.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('Where do you get templates for your presentations?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('From a number of places; I\'ve used old Fedora presentations given by other people that are appropriately licensed and borrowed their slide designs. OpenOffice also has a wealth of community-contributed templates for all of their applications, including Impress, and I use their website often to find new templates.  My favorite right now, however, is the Fedora-design-team created template.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('Where do you get the clip art for your presentations?')}</h4>
		<p>${Markup(_('I usually use the &lt;a href="%s"&gt;Open Clip Art Library&lt;/a&gt;; it\'s very easy to take the images and add them to the clip art gallery in OpenOffice.org.  I also occasionally use images or photos I find that are appropriately licensed - the search function on the Creative Commons website is really great for that.') % 'http://openclipart.org')}</p>

		<h4>${_('Do you have any other tips to share for giving awesome presentations using Fedora?')}</h4>
		<p>${Markup(_('First - I love to give presentations about Fedora while &lt;strong&gt;using&lt;/strong&gt; Fedora, so people can see just how versatile it is. Second - I always like to familiarize myself with whatever situation it is that I\'ll be presenting in before I go to do it - I just like to make sure that the projector has the appropriate cables for my machine. One of the great things about OO Impress is the ability to have the notes on my laptop screen, and have my slides showing on the projector - it really helps to be more organized-looking, and actually helps out quite a bit while presenting as well to make sure you\'re talking about what is on the screen, without having to look back at it. It\'s much easier to keep eye contact with your audience that way, too.'))}</p>

		<h4>${_('If I have a co-worker who doesn\'t use Fedora or OpenOffice.org, can they open up my presentation files?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('Absolutely! I usually find that saving the presentation to .pdf format works the best - particularly in cases where people may not have Open Office or any other presentation software installed.  You can also save presentations in a .ppt format, if you know that your recipient is using "the other" presentation software.')}</p>

		<h4>${_('Can you tell us about a recent presentation you gave using Fedora?')}</h4>
		<p>${_('Sure! I recently spoke on community marketing at the Ohio LinuxFest in early September - talking about the ways that marketing can be done in open, transparent ways in a FOSS community, big or small.  I think the best part of the presentation was actually talking about how presentations are a great way to market - and even showed off how cool it was that I was using a community-designed template for my actual presentation.')}</p>


		<h4>${_('Thanks, Robyn!')}</h4>
