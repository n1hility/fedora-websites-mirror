		<p>${Markup(_('You may have read some personal organization books, like &lt;em&gt;Gettings Things Done&lt;/em&gt; by David Allen, that advocate keeping lists of all the tasks you\'ve got on your plate. One problem I\'ve experienced using the system advocated in &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt; is that you end up with a few very long lists that can be really de-motivating to look at - all that stuff in a big, long list can be overwhelming.'))}</p>
		<p>${_('Using Gnote, however, you can store a comprehensive (and long) \'To-Do\' master list, a full \'Waiting On\' list of tasks you\'re waiting on other folks to follow up on, and a \'Someday\' or \'Tickler\' list of tasks you\'d like to do someday - and you can also store daily \'To-Do\' lists that break off a very small, digestible chunk of your longer master lists. This can be a whole lot less de-motivating, because you\'re accomplishing tasks off of your separately-stored master list, but in a way that shelters you from the overwhelming amount of tasks you haven\'t slated to work on today!')}</p>
		<h5>${_('Setting up your 3 main master to-do lists')}</h5>
		<p>${_('What you\'ll want to do first is to transcribe any of your master to-do / waiting on / someday tasks lists from your current filing system - perhaps a paper notebook - and create a Gnote note for each. If you don\'t have any pre-existing lists, here\'s a basic process for creating them:')}</p>
		<ul>
			<li>${_('Go through any notes, emails, and papers you might have, and your brain, and write down everything you need to do. Groceries, projects at work, phone calls to make - all is fair game. Jot it all down in one Gnote note; title the note \"Master To-Do List.\" I recommend using a bulleted list format - simply add a \"*\" character before your first entry in the note, and hit enter to continue on to the next bulleted item.')}</li>
			<li>${_('Create two more Gnote notes, one titled, \"Someday To-Do List,\" and one titled \"Waiting On To-Do List.\"')}</li>

			<li>${Markup(_('As your day progresses, try to work on the items you set out for yourself. As you complete items, highlight the item and press &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl+S&lt;/strong&gt; to cross it off of your list.'))}</li>

Create a fresh To-Do note for tomorrow, and copy any items you didn\'t accomplish today into it for your plan tomorrow. For any items you completed today, cross them off your \"Master To-Do List\" as well.')}</li>
		</ol>

		<p> ${_('You can keep all these lists always visible in the Gnote notes list by clicking the little thumbtack icon next to them in the list. Keeping daily to-do lists using Gnote is a great way to review what you\'ve accomplished at the end of the week, and makes it easy to write weekly status reports if your job requires that.')}</p>
		
		<h4>${_('2. Clean up those sticky-notes all over your desk!')}</h4>
		<p>${_('Tear them all down! That\'s right! Gather up all your sticky-notes, scraps of paper, notes written on the back of other papers, and make a pile.

		<li>${Markup(_('&lt;strong&gt;Shopping lists:&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the week, as you notice items you\'ll run out of or items you need for recipes you want to try, add them to a running \'shopping list\' note.

		<li>${Markup(_('&lt;strong&gt;Storing recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; Friends are always recommending restaurants to try, books to read, movies to see - but when it\'s time to eat, go to the library, or pick out a movie, I can never seem to remember those recommendations. No more! I keep running \'To Try\' lists in a variety of categories in Gnote - restaurants, books, movies, travel destinations, recipes, music albums - and during those moments where I\'m not sure what to try I bring up one of these lists.'))}</li>
