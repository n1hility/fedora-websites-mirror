Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they\'re using project resources. This isn\'t an exhaustive list of things that you can\'t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it\'s intended - a guide to make it easier to be excellent to each other.')}</p>

We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.

Members of the Fedora community should be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Fedora community and with users of Fedora.')}

It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we\'re different. The strength of Fedora comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn\'t mean that they\'re wrong. Don\'t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn\'t get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.')}</p>
