"The Fedora community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers"
" from all over the world, working on every aspect of the distribution from "

"can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have "
"a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're using "
"project resources. This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't "

"feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the "

"Fedora."

"When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and "

"that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember "
"that we're different. The strength of Fedora comes from its varied "
"community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have "
"different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone "
"holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is "
"human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to"
" help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes."
