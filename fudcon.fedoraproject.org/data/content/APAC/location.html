        <h4>Phnom Penh - October, 2016</h4>
        <br />
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <h2>Phnom Penh, Cambodia</h2>
          <p>Phnom Penh, at the confluence of the Mekong and the Tonle Sap Rivers, is the capital of Cambodia and its largest city. The beauty that made it a 'Paris of the East' before 1970 is unfortunately well hidden, though there are a few French colonial buildings remaining. The wide boulevards and promenades envisaged by the French have become parking spaces and market stalls: pedestrians are not in favour. The most pleasant strolling is to be done along the park-like river frontage, which hosts cafés and restaurants aplenty. Phnom Penh is on its best ways to become again the Pearl of South East Asia.</p>
